## DESCRIPTION
The goal of this website is to help users stay organized.  Users can add tasks to their to-do list and items to their shopping list. A statistics page will create incentive to complete tasks in a timely manner.

## Tasks Page
Users can add tasks to complete and choose whether or not to be timed for a task and can start any time they wish. 

## Statistics Page
The statstics page displays how many tasks the user has completed in any given month.

## Shopping Page
Users can add items to be shopped. When an item is clicked, the top 5 eBay results for it show up and they link to their individual product pages.
