-shopping stuff in /shopping route
-looping back to the /shopping page, no more "successful submission" page because that's distracting
-items are successfully added and retrieved from the database
-when a new user is made, their shopping table is also made
-deleted all users and associated tables because of the associated shopping tables that had to be made
-still need the search button next to each shopping item to show top 5 ebay results

-ebay stuff implemented!
-when you click on an item you gives you top 5 ebay results under it and they are hyperlinked
